# GNN-lecture

This is a repository of my solution to Stanford cs224w lecture (Winter 2023).

You can find the course materials on this website. (https://snap.stanford.edu/class/cs224w-2023/)

On top of that, online lecture is also publically provided on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAB_plj2rbA&list=PLoROMvodv4rPLKxIpqhjhPgdQy7imNkDn) :)
